# JavaFX Drawing Program

This is a JavaFX drawing program that allows you to create and manipulate shapes on a canvas. The program is written and compiled in NetBeans 8.2.

## Features

- Create circles, rectangles, ellipses, and freehand lines.
- Edit shapes by changing their properties such as size, color, and position.
- Save and load drawings to/from a file.

## Getting Started

To run the program, follow these steps:

1. Install Java Development Kit (JDK) on your system.
2. Clone this repository or download the source code.
3. Open the project in NetBeans 8.2.
4. Build and run the project.

## Usage

The program provides a graphical user interface (GUI) for drawing shapes. The following are the available options:

- **File Menu**: Provides options to create a new canvas, save the drawing, and load a saved drawing.
- **Shape Menu**: Allows you to create new shapes such as circles, rectangles, ellipses, and freehand lines.

To create a shape, select the desired shape from the Shape menu and click on the canvas area. The shape will be added at a random position with default properties.

To edit a shape:
- For circles: Right-click on the circle to open a toolbar for adjusting the radius and color. Left-click and drag the circle to move it.
- For rectangles: Right-click on the rectangle to open a toolbar for adjusting the size and color. Left-click and drag the rectangle to move it.

- For freehand lines: Left-click and drag on the canvas to draw a line.

To save a drawing, go to the File menu and select the "Save" option. The drawing will be saved to a file named "myDrawing.txt".

To load a saved drawing, go to the File menu and select the "Load" option. The previously saved shapes will be loaded onto the canvas.
